**Title:** Deep Learning for Steel Defect Detection and Localization

**Introduction**

This repository implements a two-stage deep learning approach to automatically detect and localize manufacturing defects on steel surfaces. The project aims to improve quality control in steel manufacturing by enabling early defect identification, leading to reduced waste and increased production efficiency.

**Technologies Used**

* **ResNet:** A pre-trained deep learning model for image classification, efficiently analyzing input images and identifying potential defects.
* **U-Net Segmentation Model:** Built upon ResNet, specializes in pixel-wise segmentation, providing precise localization of defects within the image.

**Dataset**

The project utilizes a dataset of 12,600 steel surface images, including examples with and without four different types of defects.

**Project Goals**

* Develop a system that can automatically detect and localize defects on steel surfaces.
* Improve overall product quality by identifying flawed materials early in the production process.
* Enhance manufacturing efficiency by automating defect detection and freeing up human resources.
* Reduce waste by minimizing the use of defective materials.
* Generate precise pixel-wise masks highlighting the exact location and extent of each defect.

**Running the Project**

**1. Prerequisites**

* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on your implementation)
* OpenCV (for image processing)
* Seaborn (for data visualization)

**2. Installation**

```bash
# Replace 'your_environment_name' with your virtual environment name (if using one)
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install required dependencies in the virtual environment
```

**3. Usage**

* Download the dataset.
* Preprocess the data.
* Train the models.
* Evaluate the model performance.
* Visualize results.

**Future Work**

* Expand the dataset size and incorporate a wider variety of defect types.
* Explore techniques for real-time defect detection on the production line.
* Investigate explainable AI methods for deeper understanding of the model's decision-making.
* Integrate the system with existing automation systems for a fully automated workflow.
